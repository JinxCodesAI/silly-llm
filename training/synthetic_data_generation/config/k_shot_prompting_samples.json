He snuggled his fluffy teddy, Blinky.\nMom smiled. She pointed out the window. \"See that tiny star? It's warm. It watches you.\"\nBenny peeked. \"Is it... a golden light?\"\nShe kissed his forehead. \"Big dream awaits. Snuggle under your bed's blue blanket. It's magic!\"\nHe hugged Blinky tight. Snuggle, snuggle. Benny's toes warmed.\n\"Mom, can we trace stars?\"\n\"Shh,\" she giggled, \"after sleep. Big dreams wear little socks!\"\nBenny yawned, yawning wide. \"Can... Dad read after?\"\n\"First, dream-bumps!\" Mom whispered.\nThe frogs hopped. The horses galloped.\nBenny giggled, pointing. \"Dad, play again!\"\nSoon, he blinked. Little by little, silence came.\nIn the soft dark, Blinky whispered, \"Sweet dreams, brave boy. Count stars, not fears.\"\nBenny patted his warm blanket. \"Night. Tired. Hug Blinky. Dream...\"\nHe slid down, slid down... into a cozy, bright castle of dreams."

She grabbed her teddy bear and a book, then crept to the couch.\nSuddenly, the book started to giggle. It whispered, \"Lily, let's dream!\" The book glowed bright, and out jumped blocks, a bunny, and a baby horse. They danced in the air, painting the room with colorful clouds. Lily's eyes blinked in surprise.\nBut soon, her toes were cold. The blocks fell, the bunny hid, and the horse galloped away. Lily shivered and whispered, \"Teddy, I'm scared.\"\nThe book opened softly. A magical door appeared, leading her back to her cozy bed. Momma greets her with a warm hug, and Lily snuggled into fluffy pillows. The moon watched with a smile."

He ate them, splish-splash-giggle!\nMorning came. Benny peeked. In his real garden, under a tree, he saw a green leaf–covered box. Inside: squishy blueberries! He nibbled one, yum! The shovel, now muddy, snuggled by a stone.\nBunny smiled. \"You are magic, Shovel!\" And the shovel thumped, like a tiny drum.\nThe tale ends here: Benny full, cozy. The shovel dreams of new digs.
