RESPONSE:

One night, Luna woke up. “Dad?” she called, her voice wobbly. Dad peeked through the door. 
“What’s wrong, little star?” “I heard a *growl*!” Luna whispered. Dad smiled. “Let’s check it out.” 
He scooped her up, warm in his arms. They tiptoed to the closet. “Boo!” A tiny, shivering monster popped out! 
Luna gasped. “It’s okay,” Dad said gently. “Maybe it’s lost?” “Hi,” Luna said shyly. “Are you scared too?” 
The monster sniffled. “I don’t like the dark!” Dad chuckled. “Dark’s just light’s bedtime!”
He flicked on a nightlight, casting soft shadows. “See? No growls here,” Dad winked. 
Luna hugged him tight. “Snuggle time!” The monster waved goodbye, slipping under Luna’s bed. 
“Wait!” she said. “Can he stay? Just tonight?” Dad nodded. “One brave girl, one brave monster. Perfect.” 
As Luna snuggled into her warm blankets, Dad’s smile made her heart feel sunny. “Night-night,” he whispered. 
“Night-night, Dad,” Luna smiled. “Love you.” And in her cozy room, she knew: even shadows can’t hide love.

RESPONSE:

Freddy the frog sat by the pond, his green belly *soft* in the moonlight. “I’ll hop home soon,” he said, but first he blinked at 
the stars. “Wink-wink!” he giggled. Suddenly, a tiny *blink*! A baby firefly zoomed by. “Lost!” it buzzed. Freddy smiled. 
“I’ll help!” He leapt onto lily pads, calling, “This way, little light!” The firefly blinked again, following Freddy through the 
reeds until—*ding!*—they found her swarm! The fireflies twinkled brightly, wrapping Freddy in glowing hugs. “Now *you* blink!” 
the baby firefly chirped. Freddy shut his eyes tight, then opened them wide. “Blink!” he croaked. The fireflies danced around him, 
laughing. But Freddy yawned. “Time for bed,” he said. They lit up his lilypad path home. His lily bed was *soft*, 
his dreams full of sparkles and hops. “Blink again tomorrow!” he whispered as he snuggled under a leaf blanket. 
The fireflies blinked yes. The end: Freddy sleeps warm, the night glows bright, and tomorrow waits for giggles.

RESPONSE:

Finley the frog frowned. “Sky sad,” he said, hopping to his lily pad bed. “Why?” asked Mama, tucking him in with a leaf blanket. 
“Stars gone! Cloudy, cloudy!” he croaked, pointing at the gray sky. Mama smiled. “Stars still there, silly hopper! 
Clouds just hug them tight.” Finley blinked. “Clouds… hug?” “Mm-hmm,” she whispered. “Now, close your eyes. Dream where clouds float.” 
Finley pointed again. “Look! Clouds… make shapes!” A tiny smile grew. “A starfish!” Mama laughed. “Goodnight, my dreamer.” 
He snuggled his blanket, whispering, “Mama? Stay till stars wink?” “Always,” she said, patting his back. Finley sighed, warm inside. 
“Night-night, sky.” And in his dreams, he jumped through clouds, chasing twinkling stars—happy, giggly, *free*.

RESPONSE:
Benny the bear held his sparkly airplane tight. “Mine!” he growled, stomping past his friends. The airplane sashayed high, 
wings glittering in the sun. “Wow!” squeaked Lila, the rabbit. “Can I play?” “Nope!” Benny said, puffing his cheeks. 
“Only *me*!” But when his airplane zoomed too far and landed in a tree, Benny wailed. “My sparkly friend!” Lila peeked up. 
“Hmm… maybe I can climb?” “Please?” sniffled Benny, ears drooping. Lila sashayed up the trunk, grabbed the plane, and slid 
down. “Here!” she smiled. Benny blushed. “But… I didn’t share.” Lila twirled. “Sharing’s how we *sparkle* together!” 
Benny handed her the plane. “You fly it too!” They giggled, chasing it through clover fields.
